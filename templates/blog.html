      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>In the age of technology and information, access to accurate and timely healthcare is more critical than ever. With the increasing importance of remote healthcare solutions, we embarked on a journey to develop a symptom-based disease diagnosis web application. Leveraging Flask for the backend and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, we created a user-friendly platform that can help users identify potential illnesses based on their reported symptoms.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The project began with recognizing a common issue: people often experience symptoms and want quick answers about their health concerns. It can be challenging to differentiate between various diseases, especially when symptoms overlap. My goal was to provide a convenient solution for users to input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.</p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>I developed a web app that allows users to enter a list of symptoms they are experiencing. The app then uses a pre-trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict the most likely disease based on the provided symptoms. Here's how it works:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Symptom Input:</b> Users enter their symptoms through a user-friendly interface and there are some list of symptoms from which user can select according to their need. The web app supports a wide range of symptoms, making it versatile for different scenarios.</li>
          <li><b>Machine Learning Model:</b> I trained the model using various algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, KNeighborsClassifier and Random Forest. After extensive testing, I selected the SVM model for its accuracy and reliability.</li>
          <li><b>Prediction:</b> The app uses the model to predict the most likely disease, providing users with instant information about potential health concerns.</li>
          <li><b>Additional Information:</b> To enhance user experience, the app also provides additional information about the predicted disease. This includes a description of the disease, recommended precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App brings the power of machine learning and healthcare information to the fingertips of users. It serves as a valuable resource for individuals looking to gain insights into their health conditions quickly and conveniently. By combining technology and healthcare, my aim to make healthcare more accessible and user-centric.</p>
        <p>In an era where remote healthcare solutions are gaining prominence, this project represents a significant step forward in providing accessible and reliable healthcare information to the masses. I hope that this project will contribute to better health awareness and ultimately improve the well-being of individuals worldwide.</p>
